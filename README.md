# Image-Processing

In this project, I use NumPy array manipulation to perform image processing tasks.

- b.jpg was removed from the center (vertical and horizontal) of a.jpg. I use slicing to put the image back together in c.jpg.
- I use NumPy to reveal 8 differences between d.jpg and e.jpg. Result is saved to f.jpg.
- I replace g.jpg with a black background, and reduce the green “halo” surrounding the minion. I then place the minion in h.jpg as shown in i.jpg.
